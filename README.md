## 🚀 About Me  

I’m a Software Developer with hands-on experience building production-ready
web applications across the front end and back end. I enjoy translating
real-world requirements into clean, maintainable code and delivering
user-focused features that balance usability, performance, and scalability.

With a strong foundation in modern JavaScript and React, I’ve worked on
full-stack projects involving APIs, data-driven UI, and collaborative Agile
workflows. I’m comfortable owning features end to end and working closely
with designers, product stakeholders, and other developers to ship meaningful
software.

🌟 Strengths: React, modern UI architecture, reusable components, accessibility  
🌱 Growing in: Backend systems, APIs, data workflows, full-stack problem-solving  
🎯 Goal: Build impactful software products that solve real problems and scale well
